## Loading and preprocessing the data
First we will load all the packages we will use. Then we will unzip and import the data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read_csv("activity.csv")
data
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
daily_data <- data %>%
    drop_na %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarize(total_steps = sum(steps))

daily_data %>%
    ggplot(aes(total_steps)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000)

mean(daily_data$total_steps)

median(daily_data$total_steps)
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
